# Information

This folder contains the azure deployment pipeline for the project.

It is **no longer maintained** in this repository, but it is hosted in azure devops. 

To reactivate it, it is necessary to run it in an azure devops repo and move the file `build-and-deployment.yml` to repository root. Also delete the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.
